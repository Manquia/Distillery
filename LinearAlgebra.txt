A vector is a set of 1 or more pairs of numbers indicating of direction and magnitude through the size of the number and sign. The number of pairs of numbers determines the demensions the vector is in.

Example:

1D vector: -1, 2, -5, 6
2D vector: {-1,2}, {-5,6}, {-10,12}
3D vector: {0,1,2}, {-1,-2,-3}
4D vector: {0,-1,2,-3}
