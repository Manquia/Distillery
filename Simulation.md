Overview of 2d and 3d math and algorithms commonly used in computer simulation.

Tier 1.00: Points
=================

A _point_ is a position in space relative to some origin or root.

**Example**: Writing 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D Vectors
```
1D vector: {x},       {2},        {-5}
2D vector: {x,y},     {-5,6},     {-10,12}
3D vector: {x,y,z},   {-1,-2,-3}, {9,2,1}
4D vector: {x,y,z,w}, {0,1,0,1},  {2,1,0,-3},
```

**Example**: 1D point for points p0{-2} and p1{5}
```
  -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
<--+--+--+--+--#--+--+--+--+--+--+--+-->
         |     |              |
         *                    *
        p0     Origin        p1
```

**Example**: 2D point for points p0{-3, 2} and p1{3, -2}
```
               ^
               |
    p0*        +2
               |
               +1
  -4 -3 -2 -1  |  1  2  3  4
<--+--+--+--+--#--+--+--+--+-->
               |
               +-1
               |
               +-2    p1*
               |
               v
```

Tier 1.01: Vectors
==================

A vector is a point which indicates a direction and magnitude. This is much the same as a point, except we tend to think of it as an arrow from the origin outward with a direction and length.
